# Study Orbit

This is a project that aims to help students in their academic journey. Our features include a to do list, deadline countdown list, study resources for various subjects, flashcards for easy and quick access to information, and lastly, our Ai-Enabled Canvas, which allows a person to simply handwrite their problem on the canvas, and our program will get the answer of the problem.

Method to use the program:

1. Download the studyorbit folder
2. Run the MAIN.py file, which will initialize the backend server for the website.
3. Go to the localhost link provided to the MAIN.py
4. All information entered in the server after initlization remains saved in our backend until the server is closed.

Method To use the Ai Canvas :
1. When you click the AI button, draw what you want to draw on the blackboard.
2. Once you are done with what you want to draw, right click in the background and select Evaluate. 
3. Next, click on the reload button on the webpage, then wait for the response of our AI-powered solver.
